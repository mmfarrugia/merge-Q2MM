If the aryl nucleophile on the heck reaction is C2 symmetric use 
Pdheckrxn-symNu.mae, otherwise use Pdheckrxn-asymNu.mae for non C2 aryls and 
alkenyls. This will use the enantiomer of the template so as to get both 
conformations of asymmetric nucleophile that I haven't been able to capture 
with conformational searches.
