# "DIR" refers to the directory that
# the code will be working from.
DIR ./
# "FFLD" does a few things including
# designating the file that contains 
# the force field that you want to 
# parameterize along with writing the
# force field to a specific file. In 
# the following instance tells the 
# code to use the "mm3.fld" file.
FFLD read mm3.fld
# The following "WGHT" argument is 
# optional and are used to alter
# default options. While the default
# weight of bond lengths is 100, the 
# following option changes it to 50.
WGHT b 50
# The "PARM" section stands for 
# parameters and it lets you either
# define the parameters or define
# the file that contains the parameters
# that are to be optimized.
PARM qparam.txt
# Reference and calculted data are "RDAT"
# and "CDAT", respectively. The commands
# and arguments can be found by running
# "python q2mmdirectory/calculate.py -h"
# in the command line. In this example
# The parameterization is comparing the QM
# charges (-jqa/-mqa), bond lengths (-jb/
# -mb) and minimized energies (-geao/-meao)
RDAT -jqa meets1.mae meets2.mae -jb meets1.mae meets2.mae -geao meets1.log meets2.log
CDAT -mqa meets1.mae meets2.mae -mb meets1.mae meets2.mae -meao meets1.mae meets2.mae
# The "COMP" section is necessary to 
# compare the refrence with calculated 
# data, but the arguments are optional.
# "COMP -p" will print out the comp while
# "COMP -o somefile.txt" will write the 
# comparison in somefile.txt.
COMP -o opt_start.txt
# Everything between "LOOP" and "END" is
# in a constant loop until convergance 
# of the "LOOP" argument is met. In the 
# following case the parameterization will
# continue to loop through gradient methods
# until the change in the penalty function
# is below 1%.
LOOP 0.01
GRAD
END
# At this point Q2MM should have developed
# a force field that perfromed the best and
# met the above convergence. Now that force
# field is written to "mm3.01.fld". 
FFLD write mm3.01.fld
# For a final comparison and output file 
# that you can analyze more thoroughly,
# the calculated data is calulated again
# with "CDAT". If there is no options given
# "CDAT" will just use the argument from
# above, otherwise it will calculate 
# any new argument you give it instead.
CDAT
# As before "COMP" writes the new comparison
# to "opt.01.txt"
COMP -o opt.01.txt
